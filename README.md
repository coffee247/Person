# PERSON class test
This is a test of an abstract __Person__ class and several derived classes 

Derived classes are:
1. Administrator
2. Manager
3. Volunteer
4. Donor

The idea is Person class will hold all of the base functionality.

Functions and data shared by Administrator, Managers, Donors AND Volunteers will be made in __Person__ class.

Functions and data unique to managers will be made only to __Manager__ class.
